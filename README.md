<h1 align="center"> Identity-Based Federated Learning</h1><p align="center">This repository contains an implementation of a federated learning system that incorporates <b>Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC)</b> for secure client authentication and message integrity checks.  The system provides a distributed machine learning environment with enhanced security features.</p>---<h2 align="center">üìÇ Files Overview (Src)</h2>### `Aggregator.py`- Main orchestrator of the federated learning process  - Manages client connections and authentication using IBI and IBS  - Implements Byzantine-resistant aggregation methods (**Krum** and **Trimmed Mean**)  - Handles training rounds and client synchronization  ---### `TNC_IBI.py`- Implements the **Identity-Based Identification (TNC-IBI)** scheme, based on [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/sym13081330)  - Provides key generation, signing, and verification methods for client authentication  - Based on TNC signature and incorporates **Kurosawa-Heng transform** as an adaptation for IBI  - **Note:** In IBI, the setup phase (`MKGen()`) would normally be executed by a Trust Authority (TA). For simplicity, this is integrated into the Aggregator.  ---### `LB_IBS.py`- Implements the **Lattice-Based Identity-Based Signature (LB-IBS)** scheme, based on [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-8801-9_11)  - Provides system setup, key generation, and signature methods  - Utilizes lattice-based cryptography for enhanced security  ---### `NeuralNetwork.py`- Defines the neural network architecture used in the federated learning process  - Implements a simple feedforward neural network with dropout layers  **Configuration:**- Task: Binary Classification  - Architecture: `input size ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 1`  - Dropout:    - `p = 0.5` between `8 ‚Üí 16`    - `p = 0.2` between `8 ‚Üí 1`  - Learning rate = **0.01**  - Batch Size = **32**  ---### `CSVData.py`- Utility class for handling CSV datasets  - Implements a PyTorch `Dataset` for easy data loading and manipulation  ---### `client.py`- Source code for a **benign client** (no attack injection over transferred weights)  ---### `client_m.py`- Source code for a **malicious client**, used to simulate adaptive adversaries  - After disconnection, it attempts to reconnect with a different attack strategy  **Implemented Attacks:**- <span style="color:orange;">Gaussian Noise</span> (`atk_opt = 0`)  - <span style="color:crimson;">A Little is Enough (ALIE)</span> (`atk_opt = 1`)  - <span style="color:teal;">Inner Product Manipulation (IPM)</span> (`atk_opt = 2`)  ---<h2 align="center">üìÇ Files Overview (Optional & Bash)</h2>### `DataPreprocessing.py`- Additional file for quick data preprocessing  ### `StartClients(_m).sh`- Bash script to run multiple threads of simulated clients  - Initializes *n* clients (specified in the main loop)  - Adapted for simulations, runs on Linux threads  ---<h2 align="center">üîë Key Features</h2>- ‚úÖ Secure client authentication using **Identity-Based Cryptography (IBI and IBS)**  - ‚úÖ Byzantine-resistant aggregation with **Krum** and **Trimmed Mean** algorithms  - ‚úÖ Flexible neural network architecture  - ‚úÖ Support for multiple clients in the federated learning process  - ‚úÖ Simulation environment for adversarial activities  - ‚úÖ Result tracking and saving for analysis  ---<h2 align="center">üöÄ Usage</h2>1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:     - `PyTorch`, `ecdsa`, `pycryptodome`  2. Run the Aggregator by executing:     ```bash   python Aggregator.py   ```     (preferably on a separate machine)  3. Connect clients to the Aggregator:     ```bash   ./StartClients.sh   ./StartClients_m.sh   ```     (for multiple clients over threads)  4. The system will automatically manage training rounds and model updates  ---<h2 align="center">üîí Security Considerations</h2>- Uses both **TNC-IBI** and **LB-IBS** for enhanced security and authentication  - Cryptographic parameters are set for a **90-bit security level (LB-IBS)**  - Implementation over **ECC (TNC-IBI)**  - Client identities are verified before participation in the learning process  ---<h2 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Note</h2><p align="center">This codebase is intended for <b>research and educational purposes only</b>.  Not intended for production deployment.  </p>---
